summary: An introduction to preprints, highlighting their benefits and
  addressing concerns.
questions:
  - What are preprints?
  - What are the benefits of posting preprints?
  - What concerns might researchers have about posting preprints?
objectives:
  - Learn what preprints are
  - Understand how preprints can benefit science and individual researchers
  - Understand the concerns surrounding preprints and how to mitigate them
keypoints:
  - A preprint is an early version of a scholarly article that has not
    necessarily undergone peer review.
  - Preprints benefit science by getting your work out there as soon as it's
    ready, to reduce delays in knowledge sharing
  - Preprints are a free way to publish open access

Begin your workshop with an introduction to the concept of preprints, along with potential benefits and drawbacks.

## What are preprints?

Give an introduction to what preprints are. It can be useful to add a discussion element to your workshop to gauge participants' understanding of preprints. You might consider briefly explaining why current academic publishing workflows can often be slow and expensive.

## Benefits of preprinting

Introduce some of the benefits of preprinting. These could include:

- Benefits for science, e.g. getting your work out there as soon as it’s ready, to reduce delays in knowledge sharing
- Benefits for researchers, e.g. as a free way to publish open access

## Acknowledging concerns

Importantly, address the concerns that your participants have. Common concerns (and how to address them) may include:

- The dangers of having non-peer reviewed studies in public view (and how to mitigate that)
- Having multiple versions of a paper out there (and how to link back to the final published version)

You might want to reassure the participants of your workshop that it’s okay to be concerned about these topics, and that your workshop will help them overcome these concerns.
