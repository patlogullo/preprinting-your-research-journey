title: Applying to your own workflow
teaching: 30
exercises: null
duration: null
summary: Consider how to apply posting preprints to your own research workflow.
questions:
  - Where to publish preprints?
  - When to publish preprints?
  - When to update preprints?
objectives:
  - Identify where to publish preprints, when to publish, and when to update
keypoints:
  - Consider the pros and cons of different preprint repositories when deciding
    where to publish your preprint
  - For many authors, publishing a preprint may be simultaneous with journal
    submission
  - Updates should be made to preprints after substantial revisions or journal
    acceptance

Guide your attendees in making a plan for their own workflow - have them write down where and when they will publish a preprint, and when they will update it. You could ask them to brainstorm ways they could ‘bake in’ preprints into their workflow, by creating trigger points, reminders, or structures in their working environment.

## Where will I publish the preprint?

Have your participants consider what preprint servers are relevant to their research. This is also a good time for your participants to consider what journals they wish to publish in and what their preprint policies are.

## When will I publish the preprint?

Have your participants consider when is the right time to publish their preprint. For many authors, this may be simultaneous with submission to a journal - but it could come earlier or later.

## When will I update the preprint?

Participants should make a plan for when they will update the preprint with new versions (e.g., after substantial revisions, peer review, or journal acceptance) and how they will remember to do so.
