Introduce your participants to the more technical details of preprinting: journal policies and permissions. The content should be specific to your participants’ research area, e.g. if your workshop is for researchers working in biological sciences, then the policies of journals in physics won’t be relevant to them.

## Understanding journal policies/permissions

Consider the following points:

- Will posting a preprint affect publishing in other journals? (check Sherpa/Romeo)
- Examples of relevant journals in your field that do/don’t allow preprints (most do!)
- Citing preprints - may be relevant as some journals don’t allow this

Funder policies
Be aware of what your funder requires (e.g., some funder policies encourage or mandate preprints in the case of global health emergencies). Giving specific concrete examples helps people take it seriously - don’t just mention “check your funder”!
