Guide your participants through the process of actually uploading a preprint.

## Preparing your manuscript for upload to relevant preprint servers

Highlight the technical details your participants will have to consider when publishing a preprint, such as how to format their manuscript for a specific preprint server, what types of files are accepted, and how to handle images and graphs. You may also want to discuss how to link preprints to final published versions of manuscripts.

Make a list of relevant preprint servers in your field to share with your participants, and perhaps discuss the pros and cons of each (e.g., some offer larger amounts of screening, or have platforms for leaving peer comments). You may want to consult a preprint server directory to compare aspects (e.g., https://asapbio.org/preprint-servers).

Consider using a toy example or guided demonstration using relevant platforms such as the Open Science Framework (OSF), medRxiv or bioRxiv. Note that some platforms offer direct submissions to journals.

## Handling feedback 

You might also want to discuss:

- Any tips for soliciting comments or views for a preprint you post
- How to handle any comments you receive on a preprint
- Note that these strategies may be subjective and idiosyncratic to the field or individual style.
